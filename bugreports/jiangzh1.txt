Test: Jiang Zhi's bug
onid name: Jiangzh
test function: village

When I test his dominion.c I used the card test first, and when i use my
cardtest2, test for the village, I found a bug. His program cannot go through my cardtest2, the number of action cards have bugs. And then I just print out the result of each steps, and I found the number of action exact has bugs. 

Test result: the card failed or action fail. 
the bug is in the code of dominion line 1336
state->numActions=states->numActions+3
fixed code: 
state->numActions=states->numActions+2

This could be reproduced by running my cardtest2 code on:
