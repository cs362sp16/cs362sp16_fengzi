Bugreports 4
Test: Jiawei Liu's bug
onid name: Liujiaw
test function: village

When I test Liujiaw's dominion, I just used the same way to test his program, firstly, I used the card test, but his program did not past my card test 2, which means his program has a bug in the village function. So I just print out all the step to see the result of the test and see the exact bug place. And I found the number of action has a bug. 

the test result print is card failed or action failed 
Bug exist on dominon.c line 679, state->numActions=state->numActions+1
bug fixed state->numActions=state->numActions+1
This could be reproduced by running my cardtest2:
