3. During my unittest, I test four functions, but I did not find any bugs on my unittest,
   I test update coins, draw cards, trash cards and is the game over, but I did not find any bugs.
   
4. 6. 
  I just use gcov to test all of my test, includind 4 card test, and 4 unit test, and I did not find any
   bugs on, and I just find the line executed is 39%, I just found in some of my card test, especially in 
   the smithy and village, some loop even did not be executed. I just think this is a great idea and tool 
   to let me test all the code I write. Honesty, I made some bugs original for my card test file, I use the gcov
   to find the bugs. This is a great tool for me. Since i just test 8 tests, I think 39% executed is great.
   I just found the whose turn function need execute more, because most of them did not execute. I think I need to 
   test it in the future, because this is very important for all program.
