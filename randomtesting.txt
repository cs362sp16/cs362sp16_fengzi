In this assignment, I wrote three random test for three different fucntions, adventurer, village and smithy. I use the random test
and I set up about 100 times to test, and it only take about 1 second to finish. And the coverage is 100% as i checked with gcov,
especially for the adventurer, I just read every line code, and I think my test just cover everything. Due to the assignment1, I add a bug
for the village test, so i used my random test, and it get the result find out the bugs, which indicate my test is great. As for the difference between the 
unit test and random test, we all know that unit test is one kind of small test, it should test some small data functions, if we use
it as some complex and large data functions, it is too small, we could use the random test, it will cover everything and it will test
all the function including every loop in the functions, and use random number and size, this is very important. Sometimes, when we use
the unit test, it will not test all like random test. We know due to the coverage, it is better to use random test, and it will have high fault
detection capabilities, because this is very important. The coverage is the most important thing for detection capabilities.
